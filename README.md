cookiecutter-pypackage-basic
============================

This is based on https://github.com/kragniz/cookiecutter-pypackage-minimal

#TODO: Update this stuff
Usage
-----

    pip install cookiecutter
    git clone 
    cookiecutter cookiecutter-pypackage-minimal/

You should then change the classifiers in `{{ package_name }}/setup.py` - it is assumed that the project will run on the latest versions of Python 2 and 3, so you should remove any classifiers that do not apply. The full list of PyPI classifiers can be found [here](https://pypi.python.org/pypi?:action=list_classifiers).

Fill out the README, and - if necessary - add a license to the project.

Explanation
-----------

The decisions `cookiecutter-pypackage-minimal` makes should all be explained here.

### README

* **README should use reStructuredText format**
  This is the format used by most Python tools, is expected by [setuptools](http://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/), and can be used by [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/).
* **As few README files as possible**
  Additional README files (AUTHORS, CHANGELOG, etc) should be left to the user to create when necessary.

### `setup.py`

* **Use setuptools**
  It's the standard packaging library for Python. `distribute` has merged back into `setuptools`, and `distutils` is less capable.
* **setup.py should not import anything from the package**
  When installing from source, the user may not have the packages dependencies installed, and importing the package is likely to raise an `ImportError`.
* **setup.py should be the canonical source of package dependencies**
  There is no reason to duplicate dependency specifiers (i.e. also using a `requirements.txt` file). See the testing section below for testing dependencies.

### Testing

* **Use [Tox](http://testrun.org/tox/latest/) to manage test environments**
  Tox provides isolation, runs tests across multiple Python versions, and ensures the package can be installed.
* **Uses [pytest](http://pytest.org/latest/) as the default test runner**
  This can be changed easily, though pytest is a easier, more powerful test library and runner than the standard library's unittest.
* **Define testing dependencies in `tox.ini`**
  Avoid duplicating dependency definitions, and use `tox.ini` as the canonical description of how the unittests should be run.
